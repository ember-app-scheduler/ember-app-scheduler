      This addon provides a way to defer work into different paint phases of the rendering process to
      get a faster FMP. It also helps to prioritize and coordinate when the paint happens for different
      parts of the page.

    <p class="docs-mb-8">
      The `ember-app-scheduler` addon provides APIs to hook into the router to determine when to
      execute its defered work. It also provides two promise-based functions, `whenRoutePainted`
      and `whenRouteIdle`, to allow you to control when specific work will execute. An example of
      `whenRouteIdle` can be seen below.
